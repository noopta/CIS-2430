How to run the Student Planner on BlueJ: 
  1. Download all the files and store them under the same folder since all the java classes are linked and the image files + txt files are necessary
  2. On blueJ open this folder that you created with all the files. 
  3. Right click on the Planner class and hit "void main(string Args[])"
  4. GUI Will appear asking for log in information. 
  5. First go to "sign up" in the bottom left and enter "anupta" as the username and "1007108" as the password then hit submit
  6. Minimize and go back to the login screen and type in "anupta" and "1007108" as the username and password respectively.
  7. GUI main menu will appear after hitting submit.

Note: You will need to create a path for the jar file that I provided.

On any other editor/compiler: Save all the files in one folder and compile Planner.java as you would any other java file.

To connect to the SQL Database: 
  1. Once GUI appears, click on "Admin Mode" on the menubar at the top.
  2. Under "Admit Mode" hit "open".
  3. Click "Connect to Database" to create a table and load all the courses from the textfile onto it.
  4. You can then add/remove courses in the database by clicking Maintain List of Courses and the "Add Course" and "Remove Course" options will appear.

The "Checklist PDF" has all the learning outcomes I had while doing this project. Such as learning about inheritance, listeners. etc. and where I applied the concepts in my code.
